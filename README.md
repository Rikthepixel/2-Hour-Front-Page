# 2-Hour-Front-Page
 I am doing a challenge in which I have to create a the frontpage in 2 hours.
 
## Restrictions
 I am working with a few restrictions:
 1. No Javascript
 2. No CSS processors and frameworks (Less, Sass, Tailwind, Windi, etc.)

## Objective
 The goal of this challenge was to make a frontpage for an online candle shop.
 The colors and design were completely up to me.
 
## Reflection
 I think it turned out pretty well. I like the colors I chose and the design I went with.
 I am not a designer, so designing this on the fly was a good challenge to me.
 
## End Product
I have hosted the end product on github pages. It isn't the best looking website, but I am pretty happy with the result!
